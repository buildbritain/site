# Build Britain

**A Programme for National Renewal**
[buildthe.uk](https://buildthe.uk)

Ten interlocking pillars of structural reform for the UK. Egalitarian, meritocratic, ruthlessly pragmatic.

## The pillars

01. **Cheap, Sovereign Energy** — Decouple electricity from gas pricing. Build nuclear (SMR and conventional). End fuel poverty.
02. **Housing as Infrastructure** — 300k homes/year. Land Value Tax. Break the house-price-as-asset model.
03. **An Economy That Makes Things** — State co-investment bank. SME-first procurement. Tax what can't leave, lighten what can.
04. **National Capacity Service** — Universal civic service, ages 18-35. Six tracks. Jobs guarantee meets strategic reserve.
05. **Fix the Causes, Not the Symptoms** — Upstream public health. Fix the food system, built environment, and prevention funding.
06. **Education for Capability** — Vocational parity. Economic literacy. Critical thinking as a tested skill.
07. **Digital Sovereignty** — UK sovereign cloud. Domestic NHS data. Platform regulation.
08. **Land Reform & the Crown** — Abolish the monarchy. Repurpose Crown and Duchy land for housing, industry, and food sovereignty.
09. **Institutional Overhaul** — Abolish the Lords. PR. Codified constitution. Strategic self-sufficiency.
10. **Identity Built on Agency** — Channel nativist energy into building, not grievance.
